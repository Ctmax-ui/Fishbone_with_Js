# Fishbone with JavaScript

## Overview
This project is a fishbone diagram generator implemented using D3.js, a powerful JavaScript library for data visualization. The fishbone diagram, also known as Ishikawa or cause-and-effect diagram, is a tool for identifying and organizing possible causes of a problem or an effect. It visually represents the relationship between a central issue and its potential causes, resembling the skeleton of a fish.

## Features

- **Interactive Interface**: Implemented with jQuery for a more intuitive user experience, allowing users to easily add, delete, and rename fishbone elements.
- **Styling**: Bootstrap 5 framework is employed for responsive and modern styling, ensuring a visually appealing presentation of the fishbone diagrams.
- **Adding and Deleting Elements**: Users can add more fishbone elements or sub-bones to further elaborate on causes or remove unnecessary elements as needed.
- **Renaming Elements**: Provides functionality for renaming fishbone elements or sub-bones to customize the diagram according to specific requirements.
